Oh-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
You know you love me (yo), I know you care (uh-huh)
Just shout whenever (yo), and I'll be there (uh-huh)
You are my love (yo), you are my heart (uh-huh)
And we will never, ever, ever be apart (yo, uh-huh)
Are we an item? (Yo) girl, quit playin' (uh-huh)
"We're just friends" (yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)
Said, "There's another" (yo), and looked right in my eyes (uh-huh)
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (yo, uh-huh)
"Baby, baby, baby, oh"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
"Baby, baby, baby, oh"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Oh, for you, I would've done whatever (uh-huh)
And I just can't believe we ain't together (yo, uh-huh)
And I wanna play it cool (yo), but I'm losin' you (uh-huh)
I'll buy you anything (yo), I'll buy you any ring (uh-huh)
And I'm in pieces (yo), baby, fix me (uh-huh)
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream (yo, uh-huh)
I'm goin' down (oh), down, down, down (uh-huh)
And I just can't believe, my first love won't be around, and I'm like
"Baby, baby, baby, oh"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
"Baby, baby, baby, oh"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
I thought you'd always be mine, mine (Luda!)
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks (woo)
She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazin'
'Cause she was so amazin'
And now, my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on sayin'
"Baby, baby, baby, oh"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
"Baby, baby, baby, oh"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
I'm gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now, I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone)
I'm gone
